# Gravitational wave sample generation code

This repository provides additional features to the repository by Timothy Gebhard and Niki Kilbertus for [generating realistic synthetic gravitational-wave data.](https://github.com/timothygebhard/ggwd/). The scripts in this repository are built on the basis of the [PyCBC software package](https://pycbc.org/), with the intention of providing an easy to use method for generating synthetic gravitational-wave samples in real and synthetic gaussian detector noise,
